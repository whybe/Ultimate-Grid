Ultimate Grid for MFC Development Kit
Dynamic Splitters with one DataSource example
=============================================


This program demonstrates how easy it is to create an
application with dynamic splitters using the Ultimate Grid for
MFC Development Kit.

Dynamic splitters allow the user to view the same data (in a
view/window) in different split windows. This enables the user
to view different portions of the grid while editing other cells.
The maximum number of dynamic splitters on one window is 2 rows by
2 columns which provides for 4 views.

The grid objects share the same DataSource off the Document object.
This method conforms to the Microsoft document-view architeture. Be
sure to read the inline comments for more information.

Unzip the file to your \Examples directory.  This program will
search for the necessary include files in ..\..\include.
