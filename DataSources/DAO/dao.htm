<p><strong>Ultimate Grid&nbsp;for MFC</strong></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Updates to CUGDAODataSource class
(previously CUG_DAO)</strong></font></p>

<p><strong>NEW FEATURES AND ADDITIONS:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Transactions :</strong></p>

<p>Support for transactions, while simple to imlement with
CUG_DAO, are now directly available. StartTransaction(),
CancelTransaction(), and FinishTransaction() are now part of the
base class, and CUGDAODataSource manages the calls to
BeginTrans(), CommitTrans(), and Rollback() on the workspace
through these overrides. This is a very handy way of providing a
crude undo buffer. Transactions can be nested to several levels.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost row appends:</strong></p>

<p>If CUGDAODataSource m_bGhostRowMode is set to TRUE, an extra
row will appear as the last record and the user can edit this row
to add records to the recordset, assuming the recordset supports
additions. For now, you should make the call to <font
 face="Courier New">SetOption(UGDAO_OPT_GHOSTROWMODE,TRUE,0L);</font>
before calling Open() or OpenSQL on the datasource.</p>

<p>Maintaining the ghost row involves both the CUGDAODataSource
and the derived control class. As records are added or deleted
the datasource calls the control through the OnDataSourceNotify()
function with a UGDSM_DAO_ADJUSTROWS message and the number of
rows in param. The control (e.g. MyCug) must take action on this
message, [ SetNumberRows(param) ].</p>

<p><strong>Record based editing:</strong></p>

<p>CUGDAODatasource now implements an edit buffer on a row by row
basis. The CUGDataSource base class functions now carry forward
the edit notifications and the OnCanMove notifications in order
to facilitate this mode of editing. If you are adding functions
to the DAO datasource class you should respect the
m_bEditRowUpdatePending boolean when performing any function that
will effect changes to the recordset or its current record
pointer. This flag is set in OnEditStart() and cleared either in
UpdateFromEditRow() or CancelEdit(). For example if you are
calling a function that will add rows to the recordset and the
flag is TRUE, you should call UpdateFromEditRow(), call
CancelEdit(), or disallow the action. </p>

<p>In the CUGDAODataSource::OnEditFinish() notification the edit
(for the entire row) is cancelled if the cancelFlag is TRUE. This
will be the case if ESC is pressed while editing or the user
clicks on a section of the control other than the grid. In the
OnCanMove or OnEditContinue notification the UpdateFromEditRow()
function is called if the edit is active and the user won't be
allowed to leave the row until either this update succeeds or the
edit is cancelled.</p>

<p>Note that a programmatic call to SetCell() will still update
the recordset directly unless the edit row is active and
coincides with the row in the call to SetCell.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Find and Sort:</strong></p>

<p>The FindNext and SortBy CUGDataSource overrides have been
added to allow CUGDAODataSource based grids to call SortBy and
FindDialog.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Support for Unicode:</strong></p>

<p>The ugdao.cpp and ugdao.h are enabled for _UNICODE builds. </p>

<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Error reporting: </strong></p>

<p>TRACE statements have been added to almost all CDAOException
exception handlers in CUGCDAODataSource, which will send
information about the error gleaned from the exception object as
well as a line number to the output window. Also, you can #define
UG_DAO_REPORTERROR to enable the DAO error to appear in a message
box for both debug and release builds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>FIXES:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Deleted records:</strong></p>

<p>GetCell() now recognizes that it is trying to retrieve values
from a record that has been deleted by another user, and sets the
cell text to #Deleted#. (This assumes the recordset is opened as
dbOpenTable or dbOpenDynaset.) </p>

<p><strong>Memory leak:</strong></p>

<p>It was possible for unhandled exceptions thrown during calls
to COleVariant::ChangeType() to leak memory. This is now fixed.</p>
