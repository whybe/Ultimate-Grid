RTL and LTR layouts and the Ultimate Grid
-------------------------------------------------------

The Ultimate Grid supports both LTR and RTL layout and it provides number of approaches to switch between the two layout modes:

1. You can use SetGridLayout () function to allow the grid to set the proper layout, or
2. you can set the "Right-to-Left reading order" style in dialog editor for the grid's place holder item,
and the gird will pick up on this style when it is attaching, or
3. you can set the WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL extended style to grid's parent, then the grid will addopt at creation time. or
4. you can use the approach described in article Q250276 in MSDN combined with EnumChildWindows.

When using this apprach your code will look similar to the following, this is also demonstrated in the CTestDlg.

// Callback function for EnumChildWindows() API
static BOOL CALLBACK EnumDlgChildWindows(HWND hwnd, LPARAM lParam)
{
	C<my class>::ToggleLayout( hwnd );
	return TRUE;
}

void C<my class>::ToggleLayout(HWND hwnd)
{
	LONG lExStyles = GetWindowLong(hwnd, GWL_EXSTYLE) ;

	// The following lines update the application layout to 
	// be right-to-left or left-to-right, as appropriate.
	lExStyles ^= WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL ; // Toggle layout.

	SetWindowLong(hwnd, GWL_EXSTYLE, lExStyles);
}

void C<my class>::OnRtol() 
{
	// Use ANSI versions of GetWindowLong() and SetWindowLong() because 
	// Unicode is not needed for these calls.
	ToggleLayout( m_hWnd );
	EnumChildWindows(m_hWnd, EnumDlgChildWindows, 0);

	// Force the tab control to re-position its scroll buttons.
	// This step is essential in order to have the grid display properly.
	m_grid.m_CUGTab->SendMessage( WM_SIZE );

	// Force the dialog and all of its components to redraw.
	Invalidate();
	UpdateWindow();
